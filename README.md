# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Overview

Analysis for a new dataset containing information about the backers who pledged to live projects. The task now is to perform ETL on this dataset and analyze the data using SQL queries.

## Process
Using Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks for the extract and transform phases. I successfully extracted and transformed the backers' contact information from a CSV file into a DataFrame, which was then exported as a CSV file. During the load phase, I created an ERD and table schema for a new table in the crowdfunding_db database, and uploaded the CSV file with the backers' information into the table. Finally, I performed a comprehensive data analysis on the crowdfunding_db database using SQL queries.
